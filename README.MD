### Usage Synchronization

#### Permissions required

For this script to work, you need to have the following permissions on the application (as a minimum):

- Sharepoint / Sites.Selected
- Microsoft Graph / Sites.Selected

Of course you could run around with full control over all sites but that is not recommended.

#### Example

```powershell


```
